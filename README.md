# oUF DispelHighlight

This is an addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft".  
It can be downloaded at [Curse](//mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ouf-dispelhighlight) or at [WoWInterface](//wowinterface.com/downloads/info00000).

## Description

oUF DispelHighlight is a element plug-in made for the unitframe framework oUF.
It does nothing by itself, and requires a layout that supports it to function.

If supported by the layout, it will highlight friendly units should they be
affected by a debuff the player can remove.

It can highlight in a multitude of ways, with customizable colors.

For details on how to implement this in your own layout, please see the wiki:
